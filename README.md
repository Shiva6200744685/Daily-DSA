# Daily Coding Challenge

Welcome to my **Daily Coding Challenge** repository! 🚀

In this repository, I aim to solve **at least one coding problem every day** to sharpen my problem-solving skills and improve my knowledge across different domains such as data structures, algorithms, machine learning, and web development.

## 📅 Challenge Overview

- **Start Date:** [Insert your start date here]
- **Goal:** Solve at least one problem daily
- **Focus Areas:** Algorithms, Data Structures, Web Development, Machine Learning, etc.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each day's problem will be organized in its own folder, containing:

- **Problem statement** (with a link to the source)
- **Solution** (code file)
- **Explanation** (brief write-up, if necessary)

The structure will look like this:

## 📚 Topics Covered

I will be solving problems from the following domains (but not limited to):

- **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, etc.
- **Frontend Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.
- **Backend Development:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, etc.
- **Machine Learning:** Regression, Classification, Clustering, etc.
- **Databases:** SQL, MongoDB, etc.

## 🔄 Daily Updates

Each day, I will:

1. Pick a new problem (from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.).
2. Write my solution in a language of choice.
3. Document my approach and reasoning (where applicable).
4. Push the solution to this repository.
